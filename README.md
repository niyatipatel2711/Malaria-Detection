# Malaria-Detection

## Introduction
This web application is based on a VGG19 which comprises of 19 layers including 16 Convolution layers, 3 Fully connected layer, 5 MaxPool layer and 1 Softmax layer VGG 19 is one of the variants of it. VGG19 is one of the variants of VGG model. In order to fulfil the purpose of detecting malaria parasite from blood smear, VGG19 based architecture is proposed in this project which is accomplished using deep learning, CNN and tensorflow.
